1. server/gemini.ts
a. Externalize & parametrize your system prompts
Current: You’ve got a huge hard-coded string in createSystemPrompt(...) (lines ~151–212).

Why change: It’s brittle, hard to test, and impossible to tweak per-role or per-deployment without a code edit.

Recommendation:

Move each role’s prompt into separate YAML/JSON files (e.g. prompts/technician.json, prompts/org_admin.json).

Load only the one the user needs.

Use simple template placeholders ({{user.name}}, {{location.id}}) to fill in dynamic bits.

b. Switch from free-form JSON parsing to function-calling or structured outputs
Current: You do JSON.parse(response.text) (line 70) and then swallow parse errors.

Why change: LLMs can drift, returning non-JSON or slightly mis-formatted text.

Recommendation:

If your Gemini model supports it, switch to its function-calling API—define a createTicket(...), updateTicketStatus(...), etc. interface.

Otherwise, wrap your parse in a strict JSON schema validator (e.g. Ajv) so you fail early and log parsing issues.

c. Guard & validate every suggested action
Current: You trust whatever aiResponse.action.type comes back and pass it to executeAction(...).

Why change: If the prompt or model drifts, it could suggest unsupported or dangerous operations.

Recommendation:

Maintain an explicit white-list of allowed action types per role (e.g. technician may only call updateStatus).

Validate incoming action.data against a Zod/Joi schema before executing.

2. server/routes.ts
a. Add rate-limiting & circuit-breaking on /api/ai/query
Why: A misbehaving UI or malicious client could spam your AI quota.

How: Use a middleware like express-rate-limit and circuit-breaker patterns (e.g. opossum) to back off on repeated failures.

b. Centralize permission checks
Current: You derive userContext via getUserContext(...), but still rely on user.role in many code paths.

Recommendation:

Introduce a permissions array on your User object (fetched from DB) instead of single role strings.

Create a requirePermission('ticket:create') middleware so both UI and AI-driven actions share the same guard logic.

3. server/storage.ts
a. Use paginated, field-limited queries for context
Current: You do getTickets() or getTickets(orgId) and then .slice(0,20).

Why: You’re still fetching every column (attachments, notes, PII) even if you’ll only send id, title, status.

Recommendation:

Add parameters to storage.getTickets(…, { limit, fields }).

Only select the minimal set of columns you actually send to Gemini.

b. Introduce a semantic “summary” field or embedding index
Why: Even 20 tickets × 250 chars each can blow your prompt size.

Recommendation: Precompute a short “ticket summary” (one-sentence) or build a small vector index (e.g. Pinecone/FAISS) and only retrieve the top 5 most relevant tickets.

4. shared/schema.ts
a. Strengthen your User & Action type definitions
Current: User has loose fields (role, organizationId, maintenanceVendorId, maybe a bare permissions object).

Recommendation:

Define a strict TypeScript enum for Role and a literal union for ActionType.

Attach a permissions: Permission[] field to User so you can do user.permissions.includes('ticket:read') instead of role === 'technician'.

5. client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts & UI components
a. Mirror your server’s permission model in the UI
Why: You’re already tailoring prompts server-side; your UI should also hide/disable buttons the AI won’t allow to run.

Recommendation:

Return permissions list in your /me endpoint.

In React, guard UI bits with <RequirePermission perm="ticket:create">…</RequirePermission>.

b. Handle streaming & partial updates
Why: AI calls can take a second or two—streaming gives a smoother UX and makes actions feel instantaneous.

How: Use Gemini’s streaming API (if available) or chunked responses and show a “thinking…” state in your chat UI.

6. Observability & Testing
Logging: Capture { userId, role, permissions, promptHash, actionType } but never log PII or full ticket text.

Telemetry: Track model latency, error rates, and action success/failures to spot drift.

Unit tests & mocks:

Write tests that mock ai.models.generateContent to return edge-case JSON (malformed, unknown action, etc.), and assert your parsing/validation layers catch them.

Test that each role’s prompt file loads correctly and contains the required placeholders.

Next Steps
Refactor: extract your massive prompt in createSystemPrompt into external, per-role templates.

Schema: lock down your JSON inputs/outputs with a validator (Zod/Joi).

Retrieval: only fetch and send minimal, pre-filtered ticket data—consider adding a relevance layer.

Security: centralize permission checks and rate-limit your /api/ai/query endpoint.

UX: mirror permissions in your React components and consider streaming responses.

This roadmap will make TaskScout (your “TaskScout” Gemini assistant) more maintainable, secure, and reliable—letting it stay focused on the user’s actual tickets without leaking data or drifting off-prompt.
