August 12, 2025 — Data‑Driven Decision Making: KPIs Every Maintenance Manager Should Track
In maintenance, “what gets measured gets managed.” By defining and monitoring the right Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), teams can turn reactive break‑fix work into a strategic asset.

Top Maintenance KPIs
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

Definition: Combines availability, performance, and quality into a single metric.

Benchmark: World‑class organizations achieve 85 percent OEE; scores below 60 percent indicate significant inefficiencies 
MaintainX
.

Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)

Definition: Average time to restore failed equipment to operation.

World‑Class Target: < 5 hours; improving MTTR by 5–10 percent annually can unlock substantial uptime gains 
LLumin
WorkTrek
.

Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

Definition: Average operating time between failures—an indicator of equipment reliability.

Planned Maintenance Percentage (PMP)

Definition: Ratio of scheduled (planned) vs. unscheduled (reactive) maintenance tasks.

Goal: Organizations target 80–90 percent PMP to minimize costly emergency work.

Preventive Maintenance Compliance

Definition: Percentage of PM tasks completed on or before the scheduled date.

Benchmark: >= 95 percent compliance reduces unplanned downtime by up to 25 percent 
eMaint
.

Maintenance Backlog

Definition: Total hours of outstanding maintenance work. Viewed relative to available technician hours—backlog > 30% of capacity indicates resource constraints.

First‑Time Fix Rate (FTFR)

Definition: Percentage of service calls resolved on the first visit.

Target: >= 90 percent FTFR drives major reductions in repeat visits and overtime.

Why These KPIs Matter
Aligns Strategy with Operations: Leaders track OEE and MTBF to justify capital investments or equipment replacements.

Optimizes Resources: MTTR and backlog metrics ensure technician workloads are balanced and critical work isn’t delayed.

Drives Continuous Improvement: Trends in PMP and preventive compliance highlight procedural gaps before failures occur.

From Data to Action
Automated Data Capture: Integrate your CMMS, IoT sensors, and ERP systems to feed dashboards in real time.

Customized Alerts: Trigger notifications when MTTR exceeds thresholds or PM compliance dips below target.

Executive Reporting: Translate KPIs into ROI narratives—e.g., a 5 percent MTTR reduction can save $250,000 annually in downtime costs.

By instituting a data‑driven culture—where every decision is backed by hard metrics—maintenance teams can shift from firefighting to foresight, unlocking higher asset utilization and lower operating expenses.
