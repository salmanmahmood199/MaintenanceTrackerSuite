# Mobile App Setup Guide - FIXED

## Issue Resolution

The mobile app was failing with "Network request failed" errors when trying to create tickets. This was due to:

1. **Incorrect API URL**: The mobile app was trying to connect to `https://taskscout.ai` instead of the local development server
2. **Missing CORS configuration**: The backend wasn't configured to accept cross-origin requests from the mobile app
3. **Network configuration**: Expo requires specific IP address configuration for local development

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend CORS Configuration Added
- Added CORS middleware to `server/index.ts`
- Configured to accept requests from Expo development server
- Supports both HTTP and Expo protocol URLs
- Allows credentials for session management

### 2. Mobile App API Configuration Fixed
- Updated `apps/mobile-app/src/services/api.ts` to use correct local IP
- Added environment variable support for flexible configuration
- Fixed TypeScript issues with header manipulation

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.example` with proper API URL
- Mobile app now detects local development vs production automatically

## Setup Instructions

### For Development

1. **Start the backend server** (from project root):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts the backend on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

2. **Get your local IP address**:
   - On Mac/Linux: `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1`
   - On Windows: `ipconfig | findstr IPv4`
   - Look for your local network IP (usually 192.168.x.x)

3. **Update mobile app configuration** (if needed):
   - Edit `apps/mobile-app/src/services/api.ts`
   - Change the IP address in the development URL to match your local IP
   - Current setting: `http://192.168.1.153:5000`

4. **Start the mobile app** (from `apps/mobile-app` folder):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

5. **Connect your device**:
   - Use Expo Go app on your phone
   - Scan the QR code displayed in terminal
   - Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network

### For Production

The app automatically uses `https://taskscout.ai` when not in development mode.

## Testing

To test if the connection is working:

1. Open the mobile app
2. Try to login with credentials
3. Try to create a new ticket
4. Check the terminal logs for successful API requests

## Troubleshooting

### "Network request failed"
- Ensure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
- Check if the IP address in the mobile app matches your computer's IP
- Verify the backend server is running on port 5000

### Authentication Issues
- The app uses session-based authentication with cookies
- CORS is configured to allow credentials
- Sessions are stored server-side with PostgreSQL

### File Upload Issues
- Images and videos are uploaded using FormData
- File size limit is 50MB
- Supported formats: images/* and videos/*

## Current Status

âœ… Backend CORS configuration added
âœ… Mobile app API URL configuration fixed
âœ… TypeScript errors resolved
âœ… Environment configuration created
ðŸ”„ Ready for testing

The mobile app should now be able to:
- Connect to the local development server
- Authenticate users
- Create tickets with media attachments
- Access all API endpoints
